  "frontend/tailwind.config.js": "Extended Tailwind configuration with Valentine-specific design tokens including custom shadows, Poppins display font, warm color palette extensions, and smooth animation keyframes.",
  "frontend/src/App.tsx": "Root application component that renders the ValentineLanding component as the main single-page experience.",
  "frontend/src/components/valentine/ValentineLanding.tsx": "Main Valentine landing page with three states (epilogue, question, celebrating); features expanded endless \"No\" loop with high-entropy feedback messages (50+ unique messages plus dynamic templates), new decorative images (stickers, garland, love note paper), enhanced micro-animations (bobbing stickers, swaying garland, twinkling sparkles, shimmer heading), intensity-scaled celebration that passes no-attempt count to overlay, and \"final give-in\" flourish badge for persistent users.",
  "frontend/src/components/valentine/ResponsiveStage.tsx": "Container component that tracks and provides viewport bounds to children for safe positioning calculations, updating on resize and scroll events; fixed TypeScript type to allow null in RefObject.",
  "frontend/src/components/valentine/InevitableNoButton.tsx": "Interactive No button with expanded label variety (50+ unique labels including \"think again\" variants and dynamic templates for unlimited attempts), stays centered for first 3 attempts with subtle visual feedback, then activates full evasive behaviors by calling behavior functions with proper parameters (position, pointer, bounds, button size, and getSafePosition) to get behavior results; renders placeholder to maintain layout when evading.",
  "frontend/src/components/valentine/useSafeRandomPosition.ts": "Enhanced positioning hook that generates safe random positions with support for edge bias, corner bias, pointer-aware repulsion, and multi-hop sequences while avoiding the Yes button reserved area and staying within bounds.",
  "frontend/src/components/valentine/CelebrationOverlay.tsx": "Enhanced canvas-based celebration overlay with intensity-scaled particle density and duration; accepts intensity prop to scale celebration \"bigness\" (1x to 2.5x particle density, spawn rates, and duration based on prior No attempts); creates denser, more varied heart and sparkle particles for full motion, and static fade-in pattern with intensity-scaled density for reduced-motion users.",
  "frontend/src/components/valentine/useCelebration.ts": "Hook managing celebration lifecycle with intensity-based duration scaling (15s base up to 25s for high intensity in full motion, 3s for reduced-motion); accepts intensity parameter and exposes isActive and isReducedMotion states.",
  "frontend/src/components/valentine/noButtonBehaviors.ts": "Defines pre-evasion behaviors (subtle visual feedback without position changes for first 3 attempts), full evasive behavior patterns (14+ escalating movement/visual effects), and cycling behaviors for unlimited high attempt counts; includes reduced-motion alternatives for all behaviors and exports getPreEvasionBehavior and getBehavior functions to select appropriate behavior based on attempt count and motion preferences.",
  "frontend/src/components/valentine/usePrefersReducedMotion.ts": "React hook that detects and tracks the user's prefers-reduced-motion system preference using matchMedia, updating when the preference changes."
