# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Refresh the “Yes” success-state message with the provided love-note copy, keep the “No” choice as an endless teasing loop, and add more cute animations/emotes with reduced-motion support.

**Planned changes:**
- Update the post-celebration success card content to exactly: headline “My cute little baby” plus two distinct body paragraphs, with improved romantic love-note typography/layout in English.
- Ensure the “No” path never ends: allow unlimited “No” attempts while always re-presenting the Yes/No choice, and show an escalating sequence of playful teasing prompts that continues beyond 5+ and very high attempt counts without breaking.
- Add additional cute visual accents and micro-interactions (e.g., hearts/sparkles, button/heading interactions) in question and success views, while providing reduced-motion-friendly non-motion alternatives.

**User-visible outcome:** After tapping “Yes!”, users see the updated love-note success card; if they keep tapping “No,” the app continues indefinitely with escalating teasing while still offering “No” and “Yes!” each time, and the UI feels cuter/more animated without harming reduced-motion accessibility.
